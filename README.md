Overview
This project is a simple calculator built using the Swing API in Java. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
User-friendly GUI built with Swing components
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Displays results in a text field
Simple and intuitive button layout
How It Works
The calculator uses Java Swing components to create an interactive GUI. Here's how it functions:

User Input

The user enters numbers using the buttons or keyboard.
The input is displayed in a JTextField at the top of the calculator.
Performing Operations

The user selects an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) by clicking the respective button.
The calculator stores the first number and the selected operation in memory.
After entering the second number, the user presses the equals (=) button.
Processing and Displaying Results

The program retrieves the stored values and performs the calculation.
The result is displayed in the JTextField.
Resetting the Calculator

The Clear (C) button allows users to reset the input field and start a new calculation.
Technologies Used
